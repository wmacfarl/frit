        <h2 style="padding-top:40px;">In May 2016 the Board of Aldermen approved 20% Inclusionary Zoning city-wide</h2>
        <h3 style="padding-top:40px;">One year later, Federal Realty is asking for a waiver.</h3>
     
        <div class="item col-sm-4">
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p> In December 2015, members of AHOC (Affordable Housing Organizing Committee) submitted a petition to raise the inclusionary zoning rate from 12.5% to 20% city-wide.  The Board of Aldermen voted unanimously to support it, rejecting FRIT's request for an exemption.</p>
        </div>
 
        <div class="item col-sm-4">
          <h4>Impact</h4>
          <p> In April 2016, RKG Associates contracted with the city to analyze the impact of the proposed ordinance.  They concluded that raising the IZ rate to 20% would have a minimal impact on large-scale developments.  FRIT filed a memo objecting to their methodology</p>.
        </div>
 
        <div class="item col-sm-4">
          <h4>What is FRIT asking for?</h4>
          <p>In April 2017, Federal Realty submitted a waiver request to the Somerville Planning Board asking for an exemption to the 20% IZ requirement.  They argue that it's not fair to change the rules midway through a development.  Their request is currently opposed by over half of the current members of the Board of Aldermen </p>

        <h1 style="padding-top:40px;">May 18: Reject the Waiver!</h1>
        <h2 style ="padding-top:10px;">Rally for Affordable Housing in Assembly Square</h2>
  
        <p class="center">For the past two months residents have written letters, made phone calls, and testified at public hearing, asking the Planning Board to vote NO on Federal Realty's proposed waiver.  Very simply, we ask them to follow the guidance of the Board of Aldermen and uphold the 2016 inclusionary zoning ordinance for all developments in Somerville, including Assembly Square.  </p>  
        <ul>
          <li>Federal Realty has proposed a 500-unit residential building as part of Phase 2.  Under 20% inclusionary zoning, this building would provide 100 affordable units.  </li>
          <li>This waiver would exempt over 25% of the total residential development in Assembly Square from the existing IZ ordinance, resulting in the loss of 37 affordable units.</li>
          <li>Updated income guidelines would not apply.  As a result, middle income families would be locked out of the process.</li>
          <li>Federal Realty petitioned the Board of Aldermen for an exemption in 2016 and was denied.  Approving this waiver sets a precedent that the Planning Board - not the Board of Aldermen - is the final arbiter on zoning decisions.  </li>
          <li>As of last spring there were 2,200 households on the waitlist for an affordable rental unit in Somerville.  SCCs most recent development at 181 Washington Street had 100 applicants for every available unit.  While market forces fluctuate from year to year, our housing need continues to grow at an unprecedented rate.  </li>
        </ul>
