        <h2>Do It Yourself, Luke</h2>

        <p class="center">Not as clumsy or random as other DIY electronics kits, our LEDsabre is the epitome of science-fiction melee weapon elegance, and is not-in-any way endorsed by LucasFilm LTD, the Walt Disney Company, or any other science fiction intellectual property holders. The kit includes:</p>

          <li>2 foot polycarbonate containment field (5/8" OD, 1/2" ID)</li>
          <li>2 foot LED strand (red, green, or blue)</li>
          <li>Polyvinyl chloride handle assembly (8" 3/4" PVC pipe + 2 2" lengths of  1" PVC pipe, pre cut) </li>
          <li>Chemical power cells (2xAA) and Power Pack</li>
          <li>Electromagnetic force sensor (14mm magnetic reed switch, form A) </li>

      <h2>Made in Somerville</h2>

      <div class="container-fluid section">

        <p class="col-md-6 center"><a href="http://partsandcrafts.org">Parts &amp; Crafts</a> is a hackerspace for kids and their friends.  We run an alternative-to-school for kids who find themselves in persistent disagreement and conflict with the structures of traditional schooling.  We run a drop-in, free community open-shop every Saturday for anyone, kid or grown-up, who wants to come visit and make something and use our tools and ask for our help.  And we host the <a href="http://somervilletoollibrary.com/">Somerville Tool Library</a>!</p>

        <p class="col-md-6 center">We run afterschool programs and school-vacation camps for kids, all on a sliding-scale from free to slightly-expensive where we offer kids our particular combination of tools, advice, expertise, and autonomy, and encourage them to be as awesome as possible.  We act as an event space for grown-ups -- we run periodic bike repair nights and crypto-parties and random other interesting events.</p>

      <h2>Give one, Get one</h2>
 
      <div class="container-fluid section">

        <p class="col-sm-4">Parts and Crafts is running a fundraiser.  We're historically very very bad at running fundraisers, historically very very bad at accessing money or resources that aren't obviously self-made.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-4">The truth is that we're bad at asking for things.  Mostly we're bad at asking for permission, but we're also bad at asking for help (perhaps largely because the many uses of money blur the line between the two.)</p>

        <p class="col-sm-4">But we're asking now.  If you buy a lightsaber kit at the give-one-get-one price, you are not only getting a pretty sweet kit for you and yours, you're also giving a kid who wouldn't otherwise get the chance to do so, the experience of building and having something awesome that they've made for themselves.</p>
