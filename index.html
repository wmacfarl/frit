          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p> In December 2015, members of AHOC (Affordable Housing Organizing Committee) submitted a petition to change the inclusionary zoning percentages ahead of the comprehensive zoning overhaul.   The previous IZ rate was 12.5% -- for every new building with 8 or more units, 12.5% needed to be designated as affordable housing.  In May 2016 the Board of Aldermen voted to raise the inclusionary rate to 20% city-wide, including developments that already have a master plan on file.</p>
        </div>
 
        <div class="item col-sm-4">
          <h4>Impact</h4>
          <p> In early 2016, RKG Associates contracted with the city to analyze the impact of the ordinance.  They concluded that raising the IZ rate to 20% would have a minimal impact on large-scale developments, which can use economies of scale to balance out the cost</p>.
        </div>
 
        <div class="item col-sm-4">
          <h4>What is FRIT asking for?</h4>
          <p>In April 2017, Federal Realty submitted a waiver request asking to be exempt from the 20% requirement on the grounds that the zoning changed mid-develompent.  The Board of Aldermen considered and rejected a similar request last year.  Currently the waiver has been proposed before the Planning Board</p>

        <h2 style="padding-top:40px;">In May 2016 the Board of Aldermen approved 20% Inclusionary Zoning city-wide</h2>
      <h3 style="padding-top:40px;">One year later, Federal Realty is asking for a waiver.</h3>
      
      
 
        <p class="center">We are asking the entire Board of Aldermen, the mayor, and the city planning staff to join us in opposing this waiver and asking the Planning Board to uphold the 2016 inclusionary zoning ordinance for all developments in Somerville, including Assembly Square.  </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Under the current ordinance the proposed 500-unit residential building would net 100 affordable units.  Reverting back to the 12.5% rate would bring that number down to 63: a loss of 37 units.</li>
          <li>This waiver would exempt over 25% of the total residential development in Assembly Square from the existing IZ ordinance.</li>
          <li>Federal Realty petitioned the Board of Aldermen for an exemption in 2016 and was denied.  </li>
          <li>Approving this waiver sets a precedent that the Planning Board - not the Board of Aldermen - is the final arbiter on zoning decisions.  </li>
          <li>As of last spring there were 2,200 households on the waitlist for an affordable rental unit in Somerville.  SCCs most recent development at 181 Washington Street had 100 applicants for every available unit.  While market forces fluctuate from year to year, our housing need continues to grow at a precipitous rate.  </li>
        </ul>

We run an alternative-to-school for kids who find themselves in persistent disagreement and conflict with the structures of traditional schooling.  We run a drop-in, free community open-shop every Saturday for anyone, kid or grown-up, who wants to come visit and make something and use our tools and ask for our help.

        <p class="col-md-6 center">We run afterschool programs and school-vacation camps for kids, all on a sliding-scale from free to slightly-expensive where we offer kids our particular combination of tools, advice, expertise, and autonomy, and encourage them to be as awesome as possible.  We act as an event space for grown-ups -- we run periodic bike repair nights and crypto-parties and random other interesting events.</p>

    <h2>Give one, Get one</h2>
 
      <div class="container-fluid section">

          <p class="col-sm-4">We aim to provide each child with a rugged, low-cost, low-power, versatile lightsaber.  To this end, we have designed a simple DIY kit from which any child can make their own.  By constructing a lightsaber out of basic materials and electronics components, children learn to think of themselves as producers of technology.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-4">One Lightsaber Per Child isn't really about ancient weapons (or hokey religions).  It's about community and inspiration and curiosity.  What children lack is not capability, but opportunity and resources.  Put this ultra-low-cost, powerful, rugged, elegant tool in their hands and contribute to making a more civilized world.</p>

        <p class="col-sm-4">If you buy a lightsaber kit at the give-one-get-one price, you are helping us continue to make our programming accessible to all children.  You are giving kids who wouldn't otherwise have it a chance to do something awesome, make something awesome, and to learn to think of themselves as doers and makers of awesome things.</p>
